## Installing Install Ubuntu 22..04[Desktop]

This was a really difficult task for me as I was doing it for the first time. I first tried to install on my own without any instruction but I wasnt able to install the iso file in my USB Drive. Then I asked few of my friends guidance.
While I was installing I encountered few errors. The errors are mentioned below
1. It booted directly to windows didnt work as dual boot
Sol By turning off fast startup under power and options settings in control panel [windows] it worked.

2. TimeZone Error/ CD Mount Error 
Sol By not connecting to internet while setting up 

3. Kernal Error 
Sol While setting up Linux it throwed a kernal Error The solution for that was using diffrent iso file (Ubuntu 22.04) rather than Ubuntu 20.04 turns out that ISO file was corrupted.

Overall it was a really good experience I enjoyed it a lot and gathered lot of information about Linux and am sure it will be really helpful in coming years.
