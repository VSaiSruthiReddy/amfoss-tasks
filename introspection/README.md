Why must we choose you?
I love technology. I like coding and want to persue my carrer in this field though I never got an opportunity to contribute but if I get this opportunity I beleive that I will do my best and contribute back to amfoss. I'm a harworking & enthusiastic person and can come up with solution even in the most difficult times.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next few weeks, I'll finish the remaining tasks, then I'll start learning programming language and get certified in it. I beleive that I'll progress at a appreciable rate if I join amfoss. I'll even focus on my academics as this is my first year and when the roots are strong the tree grows to be strong.

How would you contribute back to the club?
I love learning new things and always looks farword to it. If i get this oppurtunity, I will do every possible thing and and extend my limits to give the best to amfoss.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
No, this is one of the best ways to select club members. but, being from a new campus, Amaravati, for almost 2.5 weeks I was busy with transition and moving to Coimbatore. It would have been great if the submission date was extended.
